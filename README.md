A fun way to make a fake CAPTCHA, and a good way to prank your friends :)

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS ONLY INTENDED AS A JOKE AND IS NOT TO BE USED FOR ANY SECURITY PURPOSES!

fakeCAPTCHA is an easy-to-use mock-up captcha maker. I've added some more information in `index.js` there if you would like to customize it. When you're ready to run it, simply click on `index.html` and open it in a web browser.
